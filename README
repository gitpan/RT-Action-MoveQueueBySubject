NAME
    RT-Action-MoveQueueBySubject - Move Tickets between queues based on
    Subject

INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
        May need root permissions

    make initdb
        Only run this the first time you install this module.

        If you run this twice, you may end up with duplicate data in your
        database.

        If you are upgrading this module, check for upgrading instructions
        in case changes need to be made to your database.

    Edit your /opt/rt4/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm
        If you are using RT 4.2 or greater, add this line:

            Plugin('RT::Action::MoveQueueBySubject');

        For RT 4.0, add this line:

            Set(@Plugins, qw(RT::Action::MoveQueueBySubject));

        or add RT::Action::MoveQueueBySubject to your existing @Plugins
        line.

    Restart your webserver

CONFIGURATION
    To configure this scrip, set the @MoveQueueBySubjectConditions
    configuration option.

    It is a list of regular expressions and queues. Each regular expression
    will be check in order, if it matches the ticket will be moved to that
    queue and processing will stop.

        Set(@MoveQueueBySubjectConditions,
            '^begin', 'Start',
            'end$', 'Finale',
        );

    You can defined these as qr// if you prefer. The module does not apply
    any flags to your regular expression, so if you want case insensitivity
    or something else, be sure to use the (?i) operator which you can read
    more about in perlre.

USAGE
    Once you've configured the action, set up a Scrip to use it. At the
    Global or Queue level, define a Scrip with your preferred Condition (On
    Create is typical), this Action and a Blank Template.
