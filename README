NAME
    RT-Action-MoveQueueBySubject - Move Tickets between queues based on
    Subject

INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
        May need root permissions

    make initdb
        Only do this during the intial install. Running it twice will result
        in duplicate Scrip Actions.

    Edit your /opt/rt4/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm
        Add this line:

            Set(@Plugins, qw(RT::Action::MoveQueueBySubject));

        or add "RT::Action::MoveQueueBySubject" to your existing @Plugins
        line.

    Clear your mason cache
            rm -rf /opt/rt4/var/mason_data/obj

    Restart your webserver

CONFIGURATION
    To configure this scrip, set the @MoveQueueBySubjectConditions
    configuration option.

    It is a list of regular expressions and queues. Each regular expression
    will be check in order, if it matches the ticket will be moved to that
    queue and processing will stop.

        Set(@MoveQueueBySubjectConditions,
            '^begin', 'Start',
            'end$', 'Finale',
        );

    You can defined these as qr// if you prefer. The module does not apply
    any flags to your regular expression, so if you want case insensitivity
    or something else, be sure to use the (?i) operator which you can read
    more about in perlre.

USAGE
    Once you've configured the action, set up a Scrip to use it. At the
    Global or Queue level, define a Scrip with your preferred Condition (On
    Create is typical), this Action and a Blank Template.
